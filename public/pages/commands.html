    Twitch Chat Commands
</h1>

<h3 class="lead">Here are all the currently available commands. If you have ideas for new commands, please let me know!</h3>

<!--<code>!commands</code> - links to this page!-->

<code>!current</code> - displays what the streamer is currently playing and for how long, eg. In game as Jax for 19m
<ul>
    <li><code>runes</code> - <i>optional</i>, displays the streamer's runes for the current game</li> 
    
    <li><code>bans</code> - <i>optional</i>, displays the bans for the streamer's current game</li>
</ul>

<code>!last</code> - displays stats from the streamer's last game, eg. Jake went 0/10/0 on Singed Top and won [5h30m ago, account: jakehoffmann (NA), &lt;matchhistorylink&gt;] 
<br />
<code>!rank</code> - displays the league, division, and LP of all the streamer's registered summoners
<br />
<code>!hi</code> - say hello to HoffmannBot! Useful for verifying if the bot is currently in your channel.
<br />
<br />
<h3>The following commands are <b>only for the channel owner.</b></h3>

<code>!title</code> - changes <b>the base of your title only</b>, ie. this will not affect the current game info at the front, if any. <b>You will want to disable !title commands from other Twitch chat bots</b> so they don't conflict with each other.
